# FEMM-FOC-Simulation
FEMM simulation of field oriented control for BLDC motors

FEMM is a free tool for doing magnetic simulations. In this project, BLDC motor control using field-oriented control is simulated using FEMM software. This is done by adjusting the phase current in accordance with the FOC computation and measuring the torque produced on the rotor.
